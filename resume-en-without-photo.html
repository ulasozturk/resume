          <div class="text">
            My interest in the web, which started with the frontend, continued with the backend. I
            started to be interested in mobile with React native. Full stack web development,
            including mobile, is a field that I enjoy working in a lot. I want to work on jobs that
            contain all or any part of this stack.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            My biggest motivation in the jobs I want to work in is to improve myself. I want to work
            in jobs that will force me to learn new things and to solve problems. I want to use the
            latest frameworks and libraries, apply new methods, new techniques.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            With this approach in my own projects, I always tried to learn and apply new things or
            things I didn't know yet. If I need to open the stack that I most prefer to work with
            and find very productive: browser frontend with React.js, mobile native frontend with
            React-Native, rest api with Node.js, NoSQL database with MongoDB. I also prefer to use
            structures built on this stack (Next.js, Nest.js, Expo). React is a must for me in
            frontend. I am also interested in the backend other than Node.js (.Net, Golang, Python).
            I prefer MongoDB because its document structure makes some work easier. I am also
            interested in SQL databases.

            <div class="description">
              In this job, I developed frontend with React. I was involved in a project that has
              just started. I built a few pages and a few components. I fixed many bugs. I have
              given feedback. I have experienced working on the same project with more than one
              person. I first experienced the conflicts in git commits here. I experienced
              deployment with AWS.

            <div class="name">Audio Book App</div>
            <div class="description">
              A mobile application that provides book listening service. I am the only software
              developer on the project. In the project, the aim was to make an application that
              includes all the features in similar applications, as well as features suitable for
              our own needs. Audio stream and download are at the top of these features. HLS
              protocol is used for streaming. The mobile application was developed with React
              Native. Rest api was created with Node.js in the backend. A reverse-proxy server was
              set up with Nginx. File transfers are provided with nginx because it is fast. React.js
              and material-ui were used for the admin panel. A system with dual tokens (access and
              refresh) was developed for authentication. API requests are made with the access token
              created with JWT. Access token has a short expiry time. A new access token can be
              obtained by using the refresh token, which is given when logged in and kept in the
              database at the backend. Thanks to the Refresh token system, all sessions can be
              managed (the system used by Google and others).

          <div class="project">
            <div class="name">Todo Lists App</div>
            <div class="description">
              An extended version of traditional todo apps. There is not just one todo list, there
              are multiple todo lists. Each todo list has its own todo. So there is a layered CRUD.
              The application can be used both by logging in as a user and as a guest user without
              logging in. First, a flow was developed in which the data is kept in the client's
              local database, considering that users may not want to log in and want to use the
              application quickly. Secondly, a flow was developed where the data is kept in the
              database on the server by logging in the users. The browser frontend was developed
              with React.js. The system developed in the audiobook application for authentication
              was also used in this project. The mobile native frontend was developed with
              React-Native. The backend is developed with Node.js. The backend runs on a free Heroku
              Dyno. Frontend runs on Vercel. The public repos of these projects can be seen on my
              github profile. The web page is available at
              <a href="https://todo-lists-web.vercel.app">https://todo-lists-web.vercel.app</a>. You
              can find the mobile apk file at
